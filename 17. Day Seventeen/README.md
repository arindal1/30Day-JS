## Activity 1: Linked List

### Task 1: Implement a Node Class
Implement a Node class to represent an element in a linked list with properties `value` and `next`.

### Task 2: Implement a LinkedList Class
Implement a LinkedList class with methods to:
- Add a node to the end
- Remove a node from the end
- Display all nodes

---

## Activity 2: Stack

### Task 3: Implement a Stack Class
Implement a Stack class with methods:
- `push` (add element)
- `pop` (remove element)
- `peek` (view the top element)

### Task 4: Reverse a String Using Stack
Use the Stack class to reverse a string by pushing all characters onto the stack and then popping them off.

---

## Activity 3: Queue

### Task 5: Implement a Queue Class
Implement a Queue class with methods:
- `enqueue` (add element)
- `dequeue` (remove element)
- `front` (view the first element)

### Task 6: Simulate Printer Queue
Use the Queue class to simulate a simple printer queue where print jobs are added to the queue and processed in order.

---

## Activity 4: Binary Tree

### Task 7: Implement a TreeNode Class
Implement a TreeNode class to represent a node in a binary tree with properties `value`, `left`, and `right`.

### Task 8: Implement a BinaryTree Class
Implement a BinaryTree class with methods for:
- Inserting values
- Performing in-order traversal to display nodes

---

## Activity 5: Graph (Optional)

### Task 9: Implement a Graph Class
Implement a Graph class with methods to:
- Add vertices
- Add edges
- Perform a breadth-first search (BFS)

### Task 10: Perform BFS on a Graph
Use the Graph class to represent a simple network and perform BFS to find the shortest path between two nodes.
