## Activity 1: Array Creation and Access

### Task 1
- Create an array of numbers from 1 to 5 and log the array to the console.

### Task 2
- Access the first and last elements of the array and log them to the console.

## Activity 2: Array Methods (Basic)

### Task 3
- Use the `push` method to add a new number to the end of the array and log the updated array.

### Task 4
- Use the `pop` method to remove the last element from the array and log the updated array.

### Task 5
- Use the `shift` method to remove the first element from the array and log the updated array.

### Task 6
- Use the `unshift` method to add a new number to the beginning of the array and log the updated array.

## Activity 3: Array Methods (Intermediate)

### Task 7
- Use the `map` method to create a new array where each number is doubled and log the new array.

### Task 8
- Use the `filter` method to create a new array with only even numbers and log the new array.

### Task 9
- Use the `reduce` method to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array and log the result.

## Activity 4: Array Iteration

### Task 10
- Use a `for` loop to iterate over the array and log each element to the console.

### Task 11
- Use the `forEach` method to iterate over the array and log each element to the console.

## Activity 5: Multi-dimensional Arrays

### Task 12
- Create a two-dimensional array (matrix) and log the entire array to the console.

### Task 13
- Access and log a specific element from the two-dimensional array.

# Feature Requests

### Array Manipulation Script
- Write a script that demonstrates the creation of an array, adding and removing elements using **push**, **pop**, **shift**, and **unshift** methods.

### Array Transformation Script
- Create a script that uses **map**, **filter**, and **reduce** methods to transform and aggregate array data.

### Array Iteration Script
- Write a script that iterates over an array using both `for` loop and `forEach` method and logs each element.

### Two-dimensional Array Script
- Create a script that demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a two-dimensional array.
