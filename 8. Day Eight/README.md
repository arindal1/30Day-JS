## Activity 1: Template Literals

### Task 1
Use template literals to create a string that includes variables for a person's name and age, and log the string to the console.

### Task 2
Create a multi-line string using template literals and log it to the console.

## Activity 2: Destructuring

### Task 3
Use array destructuring to extract the first and second elements from an array of numbers and log them to the console.

### Task 4
Use object destructuring to extract the title and author from a book object and log them to the console.

## Activity 3: Spread and Rest Operators

### Task 5
Use the spread operator to create a new array that includes all elements of an existing array plus additional elements, and log the new array to the console.

### Task 6
Use the rest operator in a function to accept an arbitrary number of arguments, sum them, and return the result.

## Activity 4: Default Parameters

### Task 7
Write a function that takes two parameters and returns their product, with the second parameter having a default value of 1. Log the result of calling this function with and without the second parameter.

## Activity 5: Enhanced Object Literals

### Task 8
Use enhanced object literals to create an object with methods and properties, and log the object to the console.

### Task 9
Create an object with computed property names based on variables and log the object to the console.
