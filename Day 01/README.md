### Activity 1: Variable Declaration
Task 1: Declare a variable using `var`, assign it a number, and log the value to the console.
Task 2: Declare a variable using `let, assign it a string, and log the value to the console.

### Activity 2: Constant Declaration
Task 3: Declare a variable using `const` , assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.

### Activity 3: Data Types
Task 4: Create variable of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the `tyreof` operator.

### Activity 4: Reassigning variables
Task 5: Declare a variable using `let`, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.

### Activity 5: Understanding `cont`
Task 6: Try reassigning a variable declared with `const` and observe the error.

#### Feature Request:
1. Variable Types Console Log: Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.
2. Reasignment Demo: Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between `let` and `const` when it comes to reassignment.
