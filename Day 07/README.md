### Task 9
Use `Object.keys` and `Object.values` methods to log all the keys and values of the book object.

## Feature Requests

### 1. Book Object Script

### 2. Library Object Script
- Create a script that defines a library object containing an array of book objects and logs the library's details.

### 3. Object Iteration Script
- Write a script that demonstrates iterating over an object's properties using `for...in` loop and `Object.keys/Object.values`.
