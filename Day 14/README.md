## Activity 1: Class Definition

### Task 1: 
Define a class `Person` with properties `name` and `age`, and a method to return a greeting message. Create an instance of the class and log the greeting message.

### Task 2: 
Add a method to the `Person` class that updates the age property and logs the updated age.

## Activity 2: Class Inheritance

### Task 3: 
Define a class `Student` that extends the `Person` class. Add a property `studentId` and a method to return the student ID. Create an instance of the `Student` class and log the student ID.

### Task 4: 
Override the greeting method in the `Student` class to include the student ID in the message. Log the overridden greeting message.

## Activity 3: Static Methods and Properties

### Task 5: 
Add a static method to the `Person` class that returns a generic greeting message. Call this static method without creating an instance of the class and log the message.

### Task 6: 
Add a static property to the `Student` class to keep track of the number of students created. Increment this property in the constructor and log the total number of students.

## Activity 4: Getters and Setters

### Task 7: 
Add a getter method to the `Person` class to return the full name (assume a `firstName` and `lastName` property). Create an instance and log the full name using the getter.

### Task 8: 
Add a setter method to the `Person` class to update the name properties (`firstName` and `lastName`). Update the name using the setter and log the updated full name.

## Activity 5: Private Fields (Optional)

### Task 9: 
Define a class `Account` with private fields for balance and a method to deposit and withdraw money. Ensure that the balance can only be updated through these methods.

### Task 10: 
Create an instance of the `Account` class and test the deposit and withdraw methods, logging the balance after each operation.
