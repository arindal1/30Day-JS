## Activity 1 : Two Sum [[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)]
### Task 1 : Solve the "Two Sum" problem on LeetCode
- Write a function that takes an array of numbers and a target number, and returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
- Log the indices for a few test cases.

## Activity 2 : Reverse Integer [[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/description/)]
### Task 2 : Solve the "Reverse Integer" problem on LeetCode
- Write a function that takes an integer and returns it with its digits reversed.
- Handle edge cases like negative numbers and numbers ending in zero.
- Log the reversed integers for a few test cases.

## Activity 3 : Palindrome Number [[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number)]
### Task 3 : Solve the "Palindrome Number" problem on LeetCode
- Write a function that takes an integer and returns true if it is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
- Log the result for a few test cases, including edge cases like negative numbers.

## Activity 4 : Merge Two Sorted Lists [[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists)]
### Task 4 : Solve the "Merge Two Sorted Lists" problem on LeetCode
- Write a function that takes two sorted linked lists and returns a new sorted list by merging them.
