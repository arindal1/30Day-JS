## Activity 1 : Add Two Numbers
### Task 1 : Solve the "Add Two Numbers" problem on LeetCode [[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers)]
- Write a function that takes two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
- Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the sum as a linked list.

## Activity 2 : Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
### Task 2 : Solve the "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem on LeetCode [[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters)]
- Write a function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
- Log the length for a few test cases, including edge cases.

## Activity 3 : Container With Most Water 
### Task 3 : Solve the "Container With Most Water" problem on LeetCode [[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water)]
- Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers where each integer represents the height of a line drawn at each point. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container holds the most water.
- Log the maximum amount of water for a few test cases.

## Activity 4 : 3Sum
### Task 4 : Solve the "3Sum" problem on LeetCode [[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum)]
- Write a function that takes an array of integers and finds all unique triplets in the array which give the sum of zero.
- Log the triplets for a few test cases, including edge cases.
