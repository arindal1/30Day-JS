# 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to my repository for the **30 Days of JavaScript Challenge**! This challenge is hosted by [Chai Aur Code](https://www.youtube.com/@chaiaurcode) on YouTube. The challenge aims to help you master/revise JavaScript by tackling different topics each day for 30 days.

- Arrays
- Objects
- And more!
